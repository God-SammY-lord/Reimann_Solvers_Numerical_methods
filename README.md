# Reimann_Solvers_Numerical_methods
This repository contains Matlab code to plot and solve Reimann problemsâ€”Exact and numerical schemes.

To Run Simulations for Tests 1-5 (Exact solutions), follow the steps in the Instructions pdf attached in the Reimann Problem Test 1-5 Folder.

To simulate the Numerical schemes like Lax Wendroff's or Lax Friedrichs for Linear advection equations (with some initial condition), Just run the code file in the Numerical Scheme Linear Advection Folder. The code can be modified for times, time steps, and other initial conditions. At present, the code assumes a square wave initial state.

To get plots for Numerical schemes for Euler equations and compare them with the exact procedure. First, Run the code for Test 1 from the Reimann Problem Test 1-5 folder by following the Instructions pdf file. Then, run the Numerical_Solution.m file (in the Numerical Solutions for Euler Equations Folder) in the same work directory. 

The Final Project Report Named "Reimann_Problem_for_Certain_Hyperbolic_System" contains a detailed explanation.
